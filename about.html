<p class="lead">Actor. Writer. Executive Producer. Nice Midwestern Gal.</p>

<!-- <p class="lead">This page is about my personal story. You can <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/hire-me/">see my reel and resume here</a>. -->

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>I’m a founding member of The Katydids, a comedy team that spent many years improvising and recently created <em>Teachers</em>, a new comedy premiering January 12, 2016, on TV Land. It started life as a web series and bringing it to television has been an incredible experience.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm living in Los Angeles and seeking new, exciting artistic opportunities! I am specifically looking for on-camera acting work in both comedy and drama, and more comedic writing jobs in the television and feature mediums. I would kill for work on a good dramady.

<h2>Tell Me About Your Childhood</h2>

<p>I was born in Detroit to a therapist and a writer, so by nature, I’m an analytical artist with very deep feelings and an affinity for black coffee.</p>

<p>I graduated from The University of Michigan with my B.F.A. in Theatre Performance and my B.A. in English Language and Literature. After graduating, most people told me my next step was to move to NYC and become a poor, miserable waitress to pay the bills. Instead, I took classes at The Second City, Detroit, and realized that my heart was in improv and sketch comedy. I then became a poor, happy barista to pay the bills.</p>

<h2>Improv, Comedy, and Creating My Own Opportunities</h2>

<p>I flexed my comedy muscles in Michigan for a while at The Second City, the Improv Inferno, and the Planet Ant Theatre, and then headed to Improv Mecca: Chicago. There, I trained and performed with major comedy theatres like The Second City, iO, and The Annoyance.</p>

<p>I also taught improvisation to Chicago Public High School teens for six years through the After School Matters program, which was the some of the most rewarding work I’ve ever done.</p>

<p>Chicago is where I co-founded The Katydids, a comedy group that became known for our improv shows and viral videos. In 2012, we created <em>Teachers</em>, a web series that caught the attention of super agency William Morris Endeavor (WME). WME then helped us sell <em>Teachers</em> to Viacom’s TV Land, which is what brought me, my husband, and our pup, to Los Angeles in 2014.</p>


<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>Lately, when I’m not working on <em>Teachers</em>, I’m doing CrossFit, practicing yoga, hiking, reading, binge-watching TV, improvising with The Katydids at the Upright Citizens Brigade, and treating my dog, Piper, like she is my real human child. I express gratitude every day for my inspiring husband, my supportive parents, and all of the amazing opportunities that have come my way.</p>

<p>And hey, look at this smile:</p>
