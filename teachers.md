## What is Teachers?

Teachers is an irreverent ensemble comedy about six elementary school teachers. It will be airing on Viacom’s TV Land in January 2016. It is based on the same-titled web series which was created by The Katydids and Matthew Miller, and produced by Cap Gun Collective. The Katydids wrote, executive produced, and star in the show. Emmy-nominated Key and Peele showrunners, Ian Roberts and Jay Martel, are also showrunners on Teachers. The incredibly talented Alison Brie (Community, Mad Men) is an executive producer.

Teachers will be paired with the second season the hit show Younger, which stars Sutton Foster and Hilary Duff, and was created by Darren Star (Sex and the City, Beverly Hills 90210). The season consists of ten half-hour episodes, and includes a plethora of killer guest stars, including, but not limited to, Rob Corddry, Alison Brie, Rob Riggle, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Ian Roberts, and Lacey Chabert. Teachers is one of many new TV Land shows that are being produced to appeal to a younger demographic than what the network has historically seen.

## Going from Web to TV

Before it was a television show, Teachers was a web series!

In 2011, The Katydids were working on writing a pilot for a production company in Chicago. When considering directors for the project, Matthew Miller, a director and teacher with an extensive casting background, came to mind. That project didn’t seem to be the right match for Miller and The Katydids, but the meetings were energizing and Miller knew he wanted to collaborate with us on something in the future. 

A few months later, Miller approached The Katydids with the idea of doing a web series that focused on teachers. Miller had happened on a few articles about teachers - studies that cited teaching as one of the most adulterous and most gossip-ridden professions - and yet also one of the most admired professions. This juxtaposition, along with the relatability factor - we all know teachers or have had a teacher - led to the concept for the web series. 

In January 2012, The Katydids started writing scripts under the direction of Miller. Our very own Caitlin Barlow actually was a Chicago Public School teacher, so she had a lot of juicy bits to contribute, and we even interviewed teachers and students. We raised a few thousand dollars through a Kickstarter, and then teamed up with Cap Gun Collective, a local Chicago production company, who seemed to really dig our ideas. Cap Gun gathered some of the most talented film industry people in the city to provide us with the equipment and crew needed to make our series look top notch. Miller called in some favors to his casting pals and secured super-legit talent. Cate Freedman ventured back to the middle school that she attended and asked if we could shoot in their building. With our powers combined, we shot over twenty episodes over a three day weekend in July of 2012.

We began releasing a few episodes of Teachers each week that fall. While we were very proud of what we had produced, we had no idea what to expect. To our delight, the series was met with an outstanding amount of enthusiasm. Within a few short months, we had established a handful of exciting partnerships.The Onion released a few episodes on their YouTube channel. The Katydids formed a partnership with Above Average, the online branch of Broadway Video (SNL, 30 Rock, Portlandia). Most excitingly, super agency, William Morris Endeavor, expressed an interest in working with us to sell the series as a television show.

The Katydids, Miller, and Cap Gun, teamed up with Alec Botnick at WME, who helped us in our journey to take the series further. He introduced us to the hilarious, smart, and uber-talented Alison Brie, who joined our team as an executive producer in the summer of 2013. Our plan was to go out and start pitching to network, but before we had a chance, TV Land came to WME looking for edgy new content. WME shared our web series with them and they fell in love with it. TV Land offered us a pilot deal in the fall of 2013.

It was officially announced in March 2014 and we began to move forward. We were thrilled to welcome the Key and Peele showrunners, Ian Roberts and Jay Martel, to our team. They helped us write and produce our pilot. We were so lucky to have been paired up with a network like TV Land who supported whatever weird, funky, dark visions we had for our Teachers pilot. At first we were trying to be a little cleaner and more conservative with our material, given that TV Land is a historically family-friendly network. Much to our delight, TV Land encouraged us to stick to our voice and tell our stories the way we always have. We were so surprised to have a network empower us to really be true to ourselves. The pilot was directed by Richie Keen (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Shameless), which we shot in July 2014 with production company, Lifeboat Productions. The Katydids helped edit the piece and it was in the can by mid-August. 

For the next six weeks, we held our breath as TV Land worked with Viacom to decide whether or not we would go to series. By this point, all six Katydids had relocated to LA I hoped that we would have a series. There were some pretty big risks being taken. On October 1, 2014, it was announced that we would have a 10-episode season. Holy. Shit.

The episodes we written by The Katydids, with the guidance of Ian, Jay, and a wonderful story consultant, Jill Cargerman (Las Vegas, Working Class), over a five month period. The show was shot in seven and a half weeks at a closed down school in Northridge, California, under the leadership of producer, Keith Raskin (Key and Peele, The League). The delightful Payman Benz came on as our director for the nine episodes following the pilot. On top of all that, the Teachers was out of this world. Every single person who worked on the show was so talented, kind, and down-to-earth. There are no words to describe the gratitude I have for all of those people. As executive producers, The Katydids were heavily involved in everything from picking a logo to to making casting decisions with our incredible casting director, Sherie Hernandez (Playing House, Chasing Life). We were heavily involved in the post-production process, spending a gazillion hours in the bay with our fabulous editors and Emmy-nominated composer, Joshua Funk (Key and Peele). 

The last year and a half has been completely surreal for The Katydidsl. We wrote, shot, and edited ten episodes of a show that we created! And we suddenly all live in LA?! We joke about how it feels like we went through television bootcamp, that we should have our master’s degrees in TV-making after this immersive experience. We learned so much and worked our tails off to make our dream a reality. Instead of waiting for someone to cast us, to put us in a random role or gig, to allow outsiders to tell us who we could be, we took control. We made our own path. We stayed true to ourselves. And guess what? It worked. For better or worse, Teachers is totally us. Check it out when it airs in January 2016. We really hope you like it.

## Who the Hell are The Katydids?

The Katydids is a comedy group consisting of six women whose names all happen to be derived from Katherine. 

### That’s Interesting. Tell Me More...

Okay.

In 2008, Caitlin Barlow noticed that an iO Chicago show called Radical Concept was accepting submissions from improv teams who had crazy ideas for show forms. Caitlin realized that she knew a lot of hilarious women named Katie, so she asked Katy Colloton, Katie O’Brien, Cate Freedman, Kate Lambert, and myself if we wanted to apply. We didn’t all know each other, but trusted in the genius of Caitlin Barlow, so we all got on board. Turns out a bunch of people having the same name was not radical enough, so we did not get a slot in the show. We figured we’d do a just-for-fun one-off show at The Playground Theater instead. With no prior meeting or rehearsal, the six of us showed up and played a show. It pretty much ruled.

The Katydids continued to do low-stress, random one-off improv shows for a few months. By the fall of 2009, we realized that we had an amazing chemistry. We were all very different people and performers, but when we worked together, we formed something beautifully unique. We decided that we needed to explore this further. 

We rented out a black box theatre, Studio BE (now MCL Chicago), and did a run of shows with fellow badass improv group, Computer. The success of that run earned us a midnight show at iO Chicago. We made a series of silly promotional videos for that show with our brilliant friend, Bobby Richards, which turned out to be quite popular. We continued performing weekly at iO for a time under the guidance of our coach and Second City Mainstage alumni, Anthony LeBlanc, and went on to book improv runs at The Second City’s Donny’s Skybox Theatre, The Annoyance Theatre, and ComedySportz. We have also made multiple appearances at UCB’s Del Close Marathon in NYC, the Chicago Improv Festival, and the Southern Illinois Improv Festival in Carbondale.  We also wrote and performed one sketch show, Nice To Meet You, I Love You, at iO Chicago under the direction of Charna Halpern. 

Our successful promo videos inspired us to continue to create and produce other web shorts, some of which have been featured by The Huffington Post, MTV, Perez Hilton, Smosh, Cosmopolitan, Italy's Vanity Fair, College Humor, and The Chicago Sun Times. It was our love for making these online videos that pushed us to create the Teachers web series.

By June 2014, all of The Katydids had relocated to Los Angeles to write, produce, and star in our very own TV show. We still improvise a bit out here in Los Angeles, so check out our Twitter and Facebook accounts for up-to-date information on those shows. We’re usually at UCB once a month and occasionally show up at iO West. It’s nearly seven years later, and we’re still having a blast on an empty stage with nothing but each other’s sick and twisted minds and big old hearts. It’s quite surreal to think that six years ago, we were a group of six buddies farting around in Chicago black boxes.
